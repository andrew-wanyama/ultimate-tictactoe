# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Android App

[Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2013/06/16/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/) is similar to regular Tic-Tac-Toe except that you can't simply put a mark in your square â€” you have to win the square by playing a nested game of Tic-Tac-Toe using a 3 x 3 array of smaller tiles inside the big one. A tie happens when there are no further moves. In the case of a tie in a small board, that will count as a win for both sides in the larger game.

At this point, the game involves two human players to play against each other.
